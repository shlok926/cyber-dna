🟢 DAY 1 GOAL

By end of Day-1, you will have:
✅ Clear problem statement
✅ Final project name & pitch
✅ 7 questions (final)
✅ Scoring logic (brain of project)
✅ Output format (what user sees)

🔹 STEP 1: Lock Project Identity (30 min)
Project Name:

Cyber DNA – AI-Based Cyber Awareness Profiling System

Tagline (Devpost ready):
